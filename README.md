# GM Tools: World API

The World API is used to generate resources related to world building for role playing games. The roll tables contained in this service represent the information in Chapter 1 of the Dungeons Masters Guide for the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons.

It is part of the [GM Tools](https://github.com/sethpuckett/gm-tools-docker) suite of services. See that repository for setup instructions.
